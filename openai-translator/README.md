# JAICP ES6 bot example: OpenAI translator

A bot project which demonstrates the features of the ECMAScriptÂ 6 implementation in JAICP.

This bot demonstrates how to use the built-in `$conversationApi` to send asynchronous replies to a channel after waiting for a long operation to complete.
It acts as a translator and uses the OpenAI [Chat completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) via the [`openai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) package.
